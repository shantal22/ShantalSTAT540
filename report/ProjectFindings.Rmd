# Introduction

This report summarizes the key findings based on Mississippi traffic stop data and ACS demographic information.
The objective was to demonstrate data wrangling skills using dplyr and tidyr.

# Data Description

Two datasets were analyzed:
- MS_trafficstops_bw_age.csv: 211,211 observations, 11 variables
- MS_acs2015_bw.csv: 82 observations, 5 variables

# Key Findings

## Column Selection & Filtering
Used select(), filter(), starts_with(), and ends_with() to extract key information.

## Age Patterns
- Youngest driver stopped: 7  
- Oldest driver stopped: 86

## Arrangement
Earliest stop ID after arranging: MS-2013-07659

## Black Driver Stops
Officer D003 made 198 stops involving Black drivers.

## Tunica County Subset
Total stops: 4

## Grouped Summary
White drivers in Amite County:
- Average age: 42.10
- Minimum age: 15

## Officer Counts
Officer C055 made the most stops: 2,940

## Joined Data
Merged stop counts with ACS demographic data using left_join().

## Wide Format
Converted violation table from long to wide format with pivot_wider().

# Project Conclusion
This project demonstrates dplyr, tidyr, summarization, joins, and reshaping skills applied to real-world Mississippi traffic stop data. This project was my favorite project.
